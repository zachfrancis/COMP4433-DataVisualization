Note: This study examines the passage of married women’s economic rights reforms prior to the Nineteenth Amendment (1920, granting women the right to vote at the national level),
so states that passed laws later (i.e. Florida passed a control-and-management law in 1943) should be treated as missing data for the purposes of data visualization.
